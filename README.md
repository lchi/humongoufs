humongoufs
=============
humongoufs (pronounced the way it is spelled) is a FUSE project that lets you mount and use your Mongo database as a filesystem.  Why any would want to do this is beyond me.  

This is *NOT* a project to interact with GridFS as if it were a regular filesystem, that would be [this one](https://github.com/mikejs/gridfs-fuse), and maybe I'll think about integrating GridFS support in the future.

Installation
------------
I'll let you know when I get there.

Usage
-----
In the works.

Limitations
-----------
* No authentication support
* No GridFS support
* Very, very buggy - use it at your own risk
